# JavaScript-Homework-2
This is the homework from the second lecture of the Basics in JavaScript.
In this homework we used concatenation and interpolation to print out the input result, we used conditionals to find out what Zodiac sign we are in the Chinese Calendar, and the final and bonus project was to find the biggest number of the 5 we input, and print the result with an alert.
